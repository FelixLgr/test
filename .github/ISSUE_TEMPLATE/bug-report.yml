        ### Reproduction URL
        A public GitHub repo that includes a minimal reproduction of the bug. **Please do not link to your actual project**, what we need instead is a _minimal_ reproduction in a fresh project without any unnecessary code. This means it doesn't matter if your real project is private/confidential, since we want a link to a separate, isolated reproduction anyways. Unfortunately we can't provide support without a reproduction, and your issue will be closed with no comment if this is not provided.
